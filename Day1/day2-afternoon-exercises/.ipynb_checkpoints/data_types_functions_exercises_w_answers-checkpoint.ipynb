    "#### Case: Gutenberg Project Popular Downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "Gutenberg is a project that is aiming to distribute the public domain e-books online. It is nice because you can reach many many classical literature piece for free and online.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a nice the most popular downloads page that you can see the most frequently downloaded e-books from the website: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/%3Fsort_order%3Ddownloads\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a small application to scrape some information on the given link. The dataset looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"b_0\": {\"book_name\": \"A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas\",\n",
    "        \"book_author\": \"Charles Dickens\",\n",
    "        \"book_link\": \"/ebooks/46\",\n",
    "        \"book_downloads\": \"65436 downloads\",\n",
    "        \"book_image\": \"/cache/epub/46/pg46.cover.small.jpg\"},\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python mostly to exercise on the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using json, re, os libraries\n",
    "* List and Dict comprehensions\n",
    "* Using Functions\n",
    "* Loops\n",
    "* Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "    * .json\n",
    "    * .txt\n",
    "    * .csv\n",
    "* And some general Pythonic conventions\n",
    "    * import this\n",
    "    * requirements.txt\n",
    "    * import modules\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exercises Preperation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to your terminal and follow those steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the working directory to the current path:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd <THIS_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PATH>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activate your Python 3.7 environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate <YOUR_PYTHON_3.7_VENV_NAME>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install required packages to your environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```"
